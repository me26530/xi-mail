## 📖 Introduction

Xi-Mail is a full-stack self-hosted email service built on **Cloudflare Workers / D1 / KV / R2**, forked from [cloud-mail](https://github.com/eoao/cloud-mail) with a complete UI redesign and a series of new features.

With just a single domain managed by Cloudflare, you can deploy a full-featured email platform — completely free — supporting multiple accounts, multiple domains, and role-based access control.

## ✨ What's New

### 🎨 Complete UI Redesign (Linear-inspired)
- Rebuilt with **TailwindCSS 4** + **@vueuse/motion** animation library
- Login / Register: frosted glass card, animated gradient orbs, subtle grid background
- Sidebar: dark minimal style with unified navigation icons
- Header: compact layout, gradient Compose button, improved user info panel
- Global design tokens: indigo-violet gradients, colored shadows, unified border-radius
- **Header language toggle**: switch between Chinese / English instantly; preference is persisted

### 👤 User System Enhancements
- **Display ID**: User IDs are now random alphanumeric strings (`xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`) instead of sequential integers
- Display ID shown in: user detail panel, personal settings page, avatar hover card in header
- **Account Transfer**: Users can transfer an email account (along with all its emails) to another user by Display ID; the recipient can accept or reject

### 📬 Account Management Improvements
- Inbox / Sent sidebar: search/filter support, shows full email address for easy multi-account distinction; account list limit raised to 100
- Account actions dropdown always visible (includes Transfer entry)
- **Sent / Drafts menu items**: automatically hidden in the sidebar when the user has no send permission or the role is banned from sending
- **Re-create deleted email accounts**: soft-deleted email addresses can be re-registered and their associated data is automatically restored

### 🔄 Transfer Page (`/transfer`)
- Dedicated sidebar page to initiate transfers and manage pending / sent transfer requests
- **Received history**: All accepted / rejected incoming transfer requests are preserved in a separate history section — they no longer disappear after processing
- Header badge shows real-time pending count

### 🛡️ Permission System Redesign
- Roles now have a `level` field (higher value = higher privilege)
- Users can only generate invite codes for roles with a **lower** level than their own
- Level constraint strictly enforced server-side at invite code creation

### 🗂️ Batch Operations (User Management)
- Batch ban, batch unban, batch delete selected users
- Batch delete email accounts associated with a user

### ⚙️ System Settings Enhancements
- **Web-based domain management**: Add, delete, enable, or disable email domains directly in the System Settings UI — no need to edit `wrangler.toml`. The `domain` variable in `wrangler.toml` can be left empty once domains are configured here
- **Global API Token**: Admins can enable and generate a global token; use the `x-admin-auth` header to query emails via API without login (`GET /api/admin/mails`)
- **Email keyword blocklist**: Prevents regular users from registering email addresses containing sensitive keywords like `admin` (admins bypass this check)
- **Sender domain blacklist**: Block emails from specified sender domains; the system rejects them immediately to defend against email bombing attacks
- **Turnstile admin bypass**: When Turnstile bot verification is enabled, the admin account is exempt from completing the challenge on registration and when adding email addresses
- **Registration code hint & link**: When registration codes are required, admins can configure a hint message (e.g. "Contact admin to get one") and an external link shown as "Get Registration Code" on the register page
- **Announcement dialog redesign**: Centered Dialog with custom title, width, and HTML content; obsolete position/offset/type/duration options removed
- Domain mapping UI improvement: existing system domains shown for quick selection
- Auto-ban months input alignment fix; removed redundant "Login Background" and "Login Opacity" settings

### 🔍 Tooltip Coverage
- All action icons (search, refresh, sort, batch operations, etc.) now have consistent Tooltip hints on hover

### 🔎 Search Enhancements
- **Sub-account email search in User Management**: When searching in `/all-users`, the query matches not only the primary email but also all sub-account emails created by the user (e.g. searching `zjp2i3kzvz8m@domain.com` will surface the owning primary account)

## 🚀 Quick Deploy

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 20
- Logged in to Cloudflare: `npx wrangler login`
- A domain managed by Cloudflare with Email Routing configured

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/PastKing/xi-mail.git
cd xi-mail/mail-worker

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create Cloudflare resources
npx wrangler d1 create xi-mail          # note the database_id
npx wrangler kv namespace create kv     # note the id
npx wrangler r2 bucket create xi-mail

# 4. Configure wrangler.toml
cp wrangler.example.toml wrangler.toml
# Edit wrangler.toml — fill in the IDs from step 3, domain list, admin email, JWT secret

# 5. Build the frontend
cd ../mail-view
npm install
npm run build

# 6. Deploy
cd ../mail-worker
npx wrangler deploy

# 7. Initialize the database (first deployment only)
# Visit in browser: https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/init/<JWT_SECRET>
```

### Key wrangler.toml fields

```toml
[vars]
domain      = ["mail.example.com"]   # Email domain list (JSON array); can be left empty once configured via the web Domain Management UI
admin       = "admin@example.com"    # Admin email (cannot be changed after init)
jwt_secret  = "your-secret"          # JWT signing key (min 32 random characters)
```

## 📡 Global API Token

Enable and generate a token in **System Settings → Security → Global API Token**, then query emails without login:

```http
GET /api/admin/mails?limit=20&offset=0&address=user@domain.com
x-admin-auth: <your-token>
```

Response format:

```json
{
  "results": [...],
  "count": 100
}
```
